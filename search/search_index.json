This project is set up in a way that you can just drag and drop the LinkStack directory onto your web host's root directory without ever having to touch the source code or deal with pesky terminal commands.</p> <p>In addition to an easier setup process, this fork adds many custom features for an improved and more feature rich user experience. All UI pages feature a dark mode, which automatically applies if your operating system's or browser theme is set to dark. LinkStack adds light unobtrusive CSS animations for an aesthetically pleasing responsive design. Many small changes like this have been implemented that add up to a substantial feature set that sets LinkStack apart from other forks.</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>If you like our work, you can support LinkStack here.

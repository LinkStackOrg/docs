# Setup

The installation of LinkStack is meant to be as easy and user-friendly as possible.

In most cases, you will just be able to drop the LinkStack installation folder onto your web server, then visit this page with a browser to follow the setup wizard.

The setup wizard will:

1. Check the server dependencies
2. Setup the database (if using SQLite)
3. Prompt you to create the admin user
4. Prompt you for configuring the app

**To ensure everything works as expected, please read the [installation requirements](./requirements.md).**

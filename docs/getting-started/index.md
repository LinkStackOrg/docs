We offer a public instance that you can use to get started with our platform. You can sign up for a free account on our public instance and start creating a fully functional website with all the features and capabilities of our platform. You can customise the look and feel of your website by choosing from our pre-made templates and designs. And if you decide to set up your own instance later, you can easily export your data. So, there is no reason not to try our public instance first.

If you want to have full control over your website, you can set up your own web server. This option requires some technical knowledge, but it gives you complete control over your website. You can choose your own hosting provider, install the necessary software and plugins, and customise your website to your liking. You can find instructions on how to set up our platform on your own web server by following the link [here](https://github.com/LinkStackOrg/LinkStack#readme).

Docker is a containerization platform that makes it easy to set up and run applications in isolated environments. With Docker, you can easily deploy our platform on your own server without having to worry about the technical details of setting up a web server. You can find instructions on how to set up our platform on Docker by following the link [here](https://github.com/LinkStackOrg/ls-docker#readme).

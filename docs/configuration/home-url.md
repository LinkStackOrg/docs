# Home URL

Some people might only want to use LittleLink Custom for their personal pages. With this option, user can display their LittleLink page as the default landing page.

So for example, if your profile URL were ``my.domain.com/littlelink-custom/@admin`` this setting could display your profile at ``my.domain.com/littlelink-custom``.

To set your profile as the homepage, enter a LittleLink name as the value in the ``HOME_URL`` key field. To restore the default behavior, simply empty the field again.

The profile name can be found on the User Panel under the section ``Page``. The LittleLink Custom name is listed after the ``@`` symbol.

The name must be entered without the ``@`` symbol or the URL part. You can see an example for this below for the user ``admin``.

If this setting is applied, the previous landing page will be moved to your-domain.com/home or if youâ€™re using LittleLink Custom in a subdirectory, this would be ``your-domain.com/littlelink-custom/home``.

# Configuration: Getting Started

LittleLink Custom is based on Laravel 8 and basic configuration is done via the .env file in the root of your directory.

LittleLink Custom includes a built-in Config editor, so configuration of your instance can be done entirely over the web interface.

*For this config editor to work, PHP needs to be able to write to your .env file!*

The config editor can be found on the Admin Panel under `Admin > config`.

The main page of the editor contains the text editor, where every setting can be changed individually.

Fields beginning with an ``#`` are comments and wonâ€™t affect anything. These comments will inform you about the basic function of the config section, as well as the default value for that setting.

On the top of your config editor you can find the navigation bar which allows you to go to different modules of the editor. With these, you can back up and load your config, or upload/download your config. Also included is a PHP info section which is useful for debugging, but can be ignored.

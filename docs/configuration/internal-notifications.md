# Internal notifications

Internal notifications are internal notifications displayed on certain occasions.

All settings here are pretty self-explanatory and can either be true or false.

- ``NOTIFY_EVENTS``: Shows notifications only visible to admins about LittleLink Custom. These notifications are mostly meant for development notifications or information about possible security vulnerabilities, so we advise keeping this setting enabled.

- ``NOTIFY_UPDATES``: Displays a small message on the Admin Panel, only visible to admins, if a new version has been released.

- ``DISPLAY_FOOTER``: Displays a footer consisting of a link to the Landing page as well as a terms, privacy and contact notice. These notices can be changed on the Admin Panel.

- ``DISPLAY_CREDIT``: This setting displays a little “Powered by LittleLink Custom” notice on some pages.

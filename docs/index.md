## Function    
**LittleLink Custom provides** you with **a website similar to** [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/). Many **social media platforms only allow you to add one link**, with this you can simply **link to your LittleLink Custom page** and have **all the links you want** displayed on one site. You can share all your links to your social media platform or important links to **easy accessible and hosted on your own web-server** or web-hosting provider. On this website, other users can register and create their own links, you can access other user via the Admin Panel.

## About
**LittleLink Custom** is a fork of [LittleLink Admin](https://github.com/latuminggi/littlelink-admin) with a **set goal** of making the admin panel **easier to use and setup**, for inexperienced and first-time user's, with the addition of **many custom features** themed around customization for the individual users, LittleLink pages.

**LittleLink Custom** was made for the purpose of making LittleLink as well as LittleLink Admin **easier to use and setup**, by people who have never coded before nor have extensive web hosting knowledge. This project is set up in a way that you can **just drag and drop** the LittleLink Custom **directory onto** your web host's **root directory** without ever having to touch the source code or deal with pesky terminal commands.

In addition to an easier setup process, this fork adds **many custom features** for an improved and more feature rich user experience. All UI pages feature a **dark mode**, which automatically applies if your operating system's or browser theme is set to dark. LittleLink Custom adds light unobtrusive **CSS animations** for an aesthetically pleasing **responsive design**. Many small changes like this have been implemented that add up to a substantial feature set that **sets LittleLink Custom apart from other forks**.

# Edit Terms, Privacy and Contact

By default, LittleLink Custom includes a footer consisting of Terms, Privacy and Contact pages. These pageâ€™s content can be changed on the Admin Panel under Admin>Pages. A graphical text editor is included in this project to edit content on these pages, but basic HTML syntax is accepted.

For each section, a basic template is provided. Depending on your case and or local laws, you might want to change this.

The footer can be disabled entirely in the config.

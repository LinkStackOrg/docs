# Edit Terms, Privacy and Contact

By default, LinkStack includes a footer consisting of Terms, Privacy and Contact pages. The content for these pages can be changed on the Admin Panel under Admin>Pages. A graphical text editor is included to edit content on these pages; basic HTML syntax is accepted.

For each section, a basic template is provided. However, you may want to change this to comply or otherwise be aligned with your jursidiction's laws. Depending on your case and or local laws, you might want to change this.

The footer can be disabled entirely in the Config section of the administrator panel, under the "Show footer" toggle. Setting it to disable (grayed out) will disable the footer entirely.

Alternatively, if you wish to keep the footer, you can choose whatever home, terms, privacy, and contact links you want to display.

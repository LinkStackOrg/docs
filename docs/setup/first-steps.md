# First steps

**Your first action after setting up LittleLink Custom should be to change the password of the default administrator account.**

To ensure proper safety to your installation, you should change the login credentials to your admin account. This can be done on the Admin Panel. This is the administration interface used to configure and administer your LittleLink custom instance. You can always get to this panel from the landing page after login using the ‘Studio’ button on the top left of your screen.

On the Admin Panel, click on the ‘Profile’ section located on the sidebar on the left-hand side of your screen. Here, you can enter a new and secure password.

Be sure to read the Configuration section for further options.

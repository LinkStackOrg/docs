# Disable registration

If you wish to disable registration, you can do this on the Admin Panel of your LittleLink Custom installation.

You can find this setting under Admin>Pages on the bottom of the page. To change this setting, all you have to do is select your desired setting from the drop-down menu (either true or false) and select “Submit”. The setting should now have updated to your desired selection.
